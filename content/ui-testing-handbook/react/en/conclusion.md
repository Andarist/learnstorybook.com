Developers spend [21% of their time](https://www.niss.org/sites/default/files/technicalreports/tr81.pdf) fixing bugs. Tests help reduce the amount of work you have to do by catching defects and speeding up debugging.
But every new feature introduces more UI and states that need tests. The only way to stay productive is to implement an intuitive testing workflow.

Start by writing test cases as stories. You can reuse them in testing tools such as Jest, Chromatic and Axe. Studies suggest that reusing code can shave [42-81% off](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3188437_Evaluating_Software_Reuse_Alternatives_A_Model_and_Its_Application_to_an_Industrial_Case_Study?ev=publicSearchHeader&_sg=g8WraNGZNGPw0R-1-jGpy0XwUDeAr3qb472J6lhisyQ3l24pSmndO6anMdX2L3HdWHifsczPegR9wjA) dev time.

During development, test while you code to fix obvious bugs. That shortens your feedback loop. It also prevents bugs from hitting production which is [10x](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20100036670) more expensive to fix.

Finally, use a CI server to run all your checks across the entire UI to prevent accidental regressions.

I hope distilling these learnings into a pragmatic workflow helps you implement a solid testing strategy of your own. Let this workflow be your starting point.
